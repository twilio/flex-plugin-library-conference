## version 1.0.0

When in a call, a "plus" icon is added to the Call Canvas where you can add a external number to the call. This action executes a Twilio Function that uses the Twilio API to make a call and add this call to the current conference. In the Flex UI side, the participant is added manually and both hold/unhold and hangup buttons are available.
